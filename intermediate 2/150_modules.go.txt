// A package is the smallest unit of code organization in go.
// It groups together related go files that typically contain functions,
// types and variables.
// Every go file belongs to a package and each 
// package can be imported and used in another package.
// packages package go files into reusable components. Promotes code reuse.
// Modules manage dependencies across packages.
// versioning is managed by modules.
// packages are always part of modules, even if part of the standard library
// packages are not naturally versioned.
